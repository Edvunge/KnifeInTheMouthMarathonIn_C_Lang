### KnifeInTheMouthMarathonIn_C_Lang


the aim of this great marathon is to go through every topic covered by the c language, 
studying in detail all the basic and fundamental points of the language without leaving anything behind, 
focusing on continuous and detailed study. there will be 20 weeks of intensive and daily study, 
I hope not to miss a day, making a commit every day with at least an hour of study, seeking to master the basic aspects of the C language.
