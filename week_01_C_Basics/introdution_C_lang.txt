EDITING THE PROGRAM

simple text editors include vim, gedit on linux, or NotePad on windows, cross platform editors also
include Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.


COMPILING AND RUNNING THE PROGRAM

To run the program, this source file (hello.c) first  needs to be compiled into an executable 
file (e.g. hello on Unix/linux system or hello.exe on windows). this is done using a compiler for the C language.
